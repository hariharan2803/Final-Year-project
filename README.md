Final Year Project

Project Title : Execute Humane - Leveraging Sentimental Analysis to Enhance Mental Well-Being
Overview :
Execute Humane is a web-based platform designed to enhance users' mental well-being through real-time stress detection, mood analysis, and data science techniques.

The project features two complementary approaches:

Basic Sentiment Detection: Using TextBlob and quiz response logic to classify user stress levels and provide immediate wellness recommendations.

Advanced Stress Classification: Using a Naive Bayes Classifier trained on vectorized text inputs to detect emotional states and generate graphical visualizations of mood trends.

By applying Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning, and Data Science, the platform helps users track and improve their mental well-being.

Features
Sentiment analysis using TextBlob (NLP).

Quiz-based stress level detection with threshold-based redirection.

Machine Learning model (Naive Bayes) with vectorization and .pkl file saving.

Graphical mood trend visualization using data science methods.

User-friendly web application built with Flask and HTML/CSS.
